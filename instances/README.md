# Instances

The instances are available via Mendeley Data: https://dx.doi.org/10.17632/jcdmf2wsr3.1

To setup the instance files, it suffices to download them from the link above and unzip them into this folder.
The structure of directories should be:
```
~/sdtp/instances/
    |- GRID/
    |- LATE/
    |- NEGCYCLE/
    |- RAND/
    |- SEQ/
    |- VL/
    |- VRP/
```

Note: this structure is similar to the one used in the 'data/' folder.


## Format

We have opted to use JSON as the formatting of the instances because it is an easy format to process with JSON libraries
widely available for many programming languages.

Instructions on how to read the instances and the JSON fields available can be found in a README file in the aforementioned Mendeley Data repository.
